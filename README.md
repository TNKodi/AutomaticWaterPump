## Overview

**Automatic Water Pump** is an embedded-IoT project that automatically controls a water pump based on sensor readings (e.g., soil moisture, water level) to ensure optimal water distribution. It’s designed for applications such as:

- Garden irrigation  
- Water tank level management  
- Hydroponics or smart-farm setups  

Describe here, in one or two sentences, the high-level purpose of your repository and why someone would want to use it.

## Features

- **Automated Pump Control**: Turns the pump on/off based on real-time sensor data.  
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjust water-level or moisture thresholds without changing firmware.  
- **Low-Power Design**: Optimized to minimize power draw when idle.  
- **Status Indicator**: LED or serial output shows current pump state.  
- **Optional Remote Monitoring** (if applicable): Send status updates over Wi-Fi/MQTT/HTTP.  

Feel free to add or remove bullet points to match your project’s actual capabilities.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller Board** (e.g., Arduino UNO, ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi)  
- **Water Pump** (e.g., 12 V DC submersible pump or AC pump + appropriate relay/driver)  
- **Relay Module** (to switch pump power)  
- **Sensor(s)**:  
  - Water-level sensor (e.g., float switch, ultrasonic sensor) _and/or_  
  - Soil-moisture sensor (if used for irrigation)  
- **Power Supply**:  
  - For microcontroller (e.g., 5 V USB supply, 3.3 V regulator)  
  - For pump (e.g., 12 V DC adapter or AC mains, as applicable)  
- **Breadboard / PCB** (optional, for prototyping)  
- **Connecting Wires** and **jumper cables**  
- **Indicator LED** (optional)  
- **Push Button** or **Switch** (optional, for manual override)  

_Adjust this list to exactly match the components in your repository._

## Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE** (v1.8.13 or later) _or_ **PlatformIO**  
- **Library Dependencies** (if any, e.g.):  
  - `DHT.h` (for DHT-series sensors)  
  - `Adafruit_Sensor.h`  
  - `ESP8266WiFi.h` / `ESP32 WiFi` (if using Wi-Fi features)  
  - `PubSubClient.h` (for MQTT)  
  - `NewPing.h` (for ultrasonic sensor)  
- **Python 3.x** (if there are any supplementary scripts)  
- **Git** (to clone this repository)  

List out any additional libraries, versions, or tools that must be installed before compiling/flashing.
